#NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator:

This repository contains a simple Python script that translates a given word into the NATO phonetic alphabet. It uses a CSV file with the phonetic alphabet codes to perform the translation.

Files:
> main.py: The main Python script that reads the CSV file, creates a dictionary for the phonetic alphabet, and translates user input into phonetic code words.

> nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv: A CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet, mapping each letter to its corresponding code word.
